# What is this?
A compilation of different simulations of quadrotors for the smooth transportation of 
deformable linear objects (ropes, cables) developed during my PhD period. Each repository 
represents a step in the evolution of the PhD till the complete collaborative UAV simulator 
for cable transportation. Repositories are chronologically ordered.

# Documentation
If you are interested in other examples or mathematical backgrounds of each algorithm,
You can check the full documentation [online](https://addi.ehu.es/bitstream/handle/10810/21886/TESIS_ESTEVEZ_SANZ_JULIAN.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)

# How to use
1. Download each directory
2. Execute the main.py file in each of them
3. Add star to this repo if you like it ðŸ˜ƒ.
