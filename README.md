# What is this?
A compilation of different simulations of quadrotors for the smooth transportation of 
deformable linear objects (ropes, cables) developed during my PhD period. Each repository 
represents a step in the evolution of the PhD till the complete collaborative UAV simulator 
for cable transportation. Repositories are chronologically ordered.
